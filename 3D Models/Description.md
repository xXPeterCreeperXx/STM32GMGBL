## Here we will upload the parts needed to print or build for the project. All files must be in STEP format for me to be able to open them.

Inside the Gcode folder you can find the code to be ran on the 3D printer to make the parts. 

Only one part per file. A part can be made out of a couple of bodies, the idea is to break down the assembly into smaller data chunks, easier to modify
and troubleshoot. I will **try** to make the files parametric by using the spreadsheet function available in FreeCAD. Peter will be designing the parts.
